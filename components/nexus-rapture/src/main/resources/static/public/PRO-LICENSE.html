<p>FEES AND PAYMENT</p>
<p>Fees. Company will pay all fees specified in each Ordering Document, and shall reimburse Sonatype, at Sonatype’s actual cost and without mark-up, for Sonatype’s reasonable travel expenses that are incurred as a result of Sonatype’s performance of Training Services.  Except as otherwise specified herein or in an Ordering Document, (i) fees are based on Product Subscriptions purchased and not actual usage, and (ii) all fees owed hereunder are non-cancelable, non-refundable, and shall be paid without recoupment or set-off.</p>
<p>Payment. Sonatype will submit an invoice for all Product Subscriptions and Training Services purchased by Company pursuant to an Ordering Document, and Company shall pay all amounts set forth in each invoice no later than thirty (30) days from the date of the invoice.</p>
<p>Overdue Charges; Suspension of Service. If any fees are not received from Company when due, then at Sonatype’s discretion, such unpaid fees may accrue interest at the rate of 1.5% of the outstanding balance per month, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, from the date such payment was due until the date paid.  If any amount owing by Company pursuant to this Agreement is thirty (30) or more days overdue, Sonatype may, without limiting Sonatype’s other rights and remedies, suspend Company’s access to the Products and/or provision of the Services until such amounts are paid in full.  For the avoidance of doubt, Sonatype will not exercise its rights under this Section 5(c) if the applicable charges are under reasonable and good-faith dispute and Company is cooperating diligently to resolve the dispute.</p>
<p>Taxes. Unless otherwise stated, Sonatype’s fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any local, state, provincial, federal or foreign jurisdiction (collectively, &quot;Taxes&quot;). Except for Taxes assessable against Sonatype based on Sonatype’s income, Company is responsible for paying all Taxes associated with Company’s purchases hereunder. If Sonatype has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which Company is responsible under this paragraph, the appropriate amount shall be invoiced to and paid by Company in accordance with Section 4(b) above, unless Company provides Sonatype with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority.</p>
<p>Audit.  Company agrees to maintain complete and accurate records with respect to matters necessary to ensure Company’s compliance with this Agreement.  Sonatype will have the right, at its own expense and upon reasonable prior notice, to inspect and audit Company’s records with respect to matters covered by this Agreement (the &quot;Audit&quot;).  If such Audit reveals that Company has underpaid Sonatype with respect to any amounts due and payable during the period to which the Audit relates, Company shall promptly pay such amounts as are necessary to rectify such underpayment, together with interest in accordance with Section 5(c).  Such inspection and audit rights shall extend throughout the term of this Agreement and for a period of one year thereafter.</p>
<p>PROPRIETARY RIGHTS</p>
<p>Reservation of Rights. Subject to the limited rights expressly granted hereunder, Sonatype, for itself and on behalf of its licensors, reserves all rights in the Products and Training Materials that are not expressly granted to Company in this Agreement, and Company acknowledges and agrees that Sonatype owns all rights, title and interest in and to the Products and Training Materials.  All rights, title and interest in and to any and all improvements, modifications, derivative works and innovations of, to and/or involving the Products and Training Materials will be retained in full and owned by Sonatype, even if such improvements, modifications, derivative works or innovations result from suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or other feedback provided to Sonatype by or on behalf of Company.  Company agrees not to challenge, directly or indirectly, Sonatype’s right, title, and interest in and to the Products or Training Materials, and further agrees that it will not directly or indirectly, register, apply for registration, or attempt to acquire any legal protection for any of the Products and Training Materials.</p>
<p>Open Source Software.  The Products may be provided together with, or otherwise contain, certain Open Source Software, each licensed to Company under the respective open source license agreement (the &quot;Open Source License&quot;).  Company hereby acknowledges and agrees to the terms and conditions in each such Open Source License.  Any fees charged by Sonatype in connection with the Products do not apply to any Open Source Software for which fees may not be charged under the applicable Open Source License.  In the event of a conflict between the terms of an applicable Open Source License and the terms of this Agreement, the terms of the Open Source License shall control solely with respect to the applicable Open Source Software.  If the terms of any specific Open Source License entitle Company to the source code of the respective Open Source Software (if any), that source code may be available from Sonatype upon request (a nominal fee may be charged by Sonatype for processing such request).</p>
<p>CONFIDENTIALITY</p>
<p>Definition of Confidential Information. As used herein, &quot;Confidential Information&quot; means all confidential information disclosed by a Party (&quot;Disclosing Party&quot;) to the other Party (&quot;Receiving Party&quot;), whether orally or in writing, that is designated as confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure.  Confidential Information of each Party shall include the terms and conditions of this Agreement and all Ordering Documents, as well as business and marketing plans, research, development, services, customers, customer lists, designs, drawings, technology and technical information, products, product plans, software, developments, inventions, processes, formulas, finances, and business processes of such Party; and Sonatype’s Confidential Information shall include the Products, the Training Materials and the Documentation.  However, Confidential Information shall not include any information that (i) is or becomes generally known to the public without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, (ii) was known to the Receiving Party prior to its disclosure by the Disclosing Party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, (iii) is received from a third party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, or (iv) was independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of or access to the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.</p>
<p>Protection of Confidential Information. Except as otherwise permitted in writing by the Disclosing Party, (i) the Receiving Party shall use the same degree of care that it uses to protect its own confidential information of like kind (but in no event less than reasonable care) not to disclose any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party or use it for any purpose beyond the scope of this Agreement, and (ii) the Receiving Party shall limit access to Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to those of its employees, contractors and agents who need such access for purposes consistent with this Agreement, who have signed confidentiality agreements with the Receiving Party containing terms that are no less protective of the Confidential Information than those herein, and for whom the Receiving Party remains fully liable.</p>
<p>Compelled Disclosure. The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party if it is compelled by law to do so, provided the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prior written notice of such compelled disclosure (to the extent not legally prohibited) and reasonable assistance, at the Disclosing Party's cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure.</p>
<p>Injunctive Relief.  Each Party acknowledges that the extent of damages in the event of any threatened or actual breach of this Section 7 would be difficult or impossible to ascertain and that there would be available no adequate remedy at law in the event of any such breach.  Each Party therefore agrees that, in the event it breaches this Section 7, the other Party will be entitled to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief, in addition to any other relief to which it may be entitled at law or in equity.  Any such relief shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any relief in the form of monetary damages.</p>
<p>WARRANTIES AND DISCLAIMERS</p>
<p>Sonatype’s Warranties.

<p>Mutual Warranties. Each Party represents and warrants that (i) it has the full right, power and authority to enter into this Agreement and perform its obligations hereunder; (ii) its execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement will not conflict with or result in a breach or other violation of any agreement or other third party obligation by which it is bound; (iii) when executed and delivered, this Agreement will constitute a legal, valid and binding obligation enforceable against it in accordance with its terms; and (iv) it will comply with all applicable laws in its performance of this Agreement.</p>

EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, SONATYPE MAKES NO AND HEREBY DISCLAIMS, AND COMPANY HEREBY WAIVES, ANY AND ALL, REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES REGARDING THIS AGREEMENT OR THE PRODUCTS, SERVICES, REPORTS AND/OR TRAINING MATERIALS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT AND ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED SERVICE.  FURTHERMORE, THE PRODUCTS, SERVICES, REPORTS AND TRAINING MATERIALS MAY BE SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS, DELAYS, AND OTHER PROBLEMS INHERENT IN THE USE OF THE INTERNET AND ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS, AND SONATYPE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DELAYS, DELIVERY FAILURES, OR OTHER DAMAGE RESULTING FROM SUCH PROBLEMS.

AS SUCH, COMPANY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE INFORMATION AND DATA INCLUDED IN SUCH REPORTS MAY NOT BE ACCURATE OR COMPLETE. FURTHERMORE, REFERENCES TO AND ANY CATEGORIZATION OF OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENTS (OR TERMS THEREOF) INCLUDED IN A REPORT DO NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL ADVICE OR GUIDANCE, AND COMPANY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT IT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SEEKING APPROPRIATE LEGAL ADVICE REGARDING COMPANY’S RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH IN ANY SUCH LICENSE AGREEMENT.</p>
<p>Open Source Software Disclaimers.  Company may use the Products to access and use certain Open Source Software as artifacts that Company may retrieve from certain Open Source Software code repositories or any other public places or sites.  Any such Open Source Software is not licensed by or through Sonatype, and Company is solely responsible for determining its right to copy, modify or otherwise use such Open Source Software and for complying with the terms and conditions of the applicable license that governs such Open Source Software. SONATYPE MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS AND WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY REGARDING SUCH OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE AND/OR COMPANY’S ACCESS TO AND/OR USE THEREOF.</p>
<p>INDEMNIFICATION.  Sonatype shall defend Company against any claim, demand, suit, or proceeding (&quot;Claim&quot;) made or brought against Company by a third party alleging that Company’s use of the Products as permitted in accordance with this Agreement infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property rights of a third party, and shall indemnify Company for any damages finally awarded against, and for reasonable attorney’s fees incurred by, Company in connection with any such Claim; provided that Company (a) promptly gives Sonatype written notice of the Claim; (b) gives Sonatype sole control of the defense and settlement of the Claim; and (c) provides to Sonatype all reasonable assistance, at Sonatype’s expense.  Sonatype shall have no liability under this Agreement with respect to any Claim based upon: (i) combination or use of the Products with equipment, products, systems, software, materials or processes not furnished by Sonatype if, absent such combination, no infringement would exist; (ii) use of the Products in a manner inconsistent with the Documentation; (iii) use of the Products which use breaches this Agreement; or (iv) use of any version of the Products other than the most current version or failure to timely implement any new release, modification, update, or replacement of the Products made available to Company by Sonatype.  If Company’s use of a Product is, or in Sonatype’s opinion is likely to be, enjoined due to a Claim, then Sonatype may: (A) procure for Company the right to continue using such Product per the terms of this Agreement; (B) replace or modify the applicable Product so that it is non-infringing and substantially equivalent in function to the enjoined Product; or (C) terminate Company’s Subscription to access and use the Product and, provided Company complies with its post-termination obligations hereunder, refund any unused, prepaid fees covering the remainder of the Subscription Term after the effective date of such termination.  This Section 9 states Sonatype’s sole liability to Company, and Company’s exclusive remedy against Sonatype, for any and all Claim(s).</p>
<p>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR OTHER THEORY), TO THE OTHER PARTY OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFIT, BUSINESS OR DATA) ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT.  EXCEPT FOR AMOUNTS TO BE PAID PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OR DAMAGES ARISING FROM A BREACH OF SECTION 7, THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF SONATYPE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, WILL NOT EXCEED THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT PAID AND PAYABLE BY COMPANY TO SONATYPE DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE ON WHICH A CLAIM ARISES.</p>
