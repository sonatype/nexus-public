## Build Requirements

Builds use Apache Maven and require Java 17. Apache Maven wrapper scripts are included in the source tree.

### Configuring Maven for SNAPSHOT Dependencies

Following best practices, the nexus-public POM does not include any root `<repositories>` elements.

## Building From Source

Released versions are tagged and branched using a name of the form `release-{version}`. For example: `release-3.72.0-04`

To build a tagged release, first fetch all tags:

```shell
git fetch --tags
```

Then checkout the remote branch you want. For example:

```shell
git checkout -b release-3.72.0-04 origin/release-3.72.0-04 --
```

Then build using the included Maven wrapper script. For example:

```shell
./mvnw clean install -Dpublic
```

The `public` property is required outside of Sonatype's internal infrastructure.

## Running

To run Nexus Repository, after building, unzip the assembly and start the server:

    unzip -d target assemblies/nexus-base-template/target/nexus-base-template-*.zip
    ./target/nexus-base-template-*/bin/nexus console

The `nexus-base-template` assembly is used as the basis for the official Sonatype Nexus Repository distributions.
