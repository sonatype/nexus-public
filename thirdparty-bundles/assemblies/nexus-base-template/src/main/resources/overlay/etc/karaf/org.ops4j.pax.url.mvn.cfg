# The following locations are checked for the existence of the settings.xml file
#   * 1. looks for the specified url

# Default to Karaf's system repository, comment this out to use your local repository

# Comma separated list of repositories scanned when resolving an artifact.
# Those repositories will be checked before iterating through the
#    below list of repositories and even before the local repository
# A repository url can be appended with zero or more of the following flags:
#    @snapshots  : the repository contains snapshots
#    @noreleases : the repository does not contain any released artifacts
#
# The following property value will add the system folder as a repo.
#
org.ops4j.pax.url.mvn.defaultRepositories=\

#
# Comma separated list of repositories scanned when resolving an artifact.
# A repository url can be appended with zero or more of the following flags:
#    @snapshots  : the repository contains snapshots
#    @noreleases : the repository does not contain any released artifacts
#    @id=repoid  : the id for the repository, just like in the settings.xml this is optional but recommended
#
# The default list doesn't contain any snapshot repositories as it can impact artifact resolution.
# During development you may want to add the following repositories containing snapshots:
#    https://repository.apache.org/content/groups/snapshots-group@id=apache@snapshots@noreleases
#    https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots@id=sonatype@snapshots@norelease
#    https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/ops4j-snapshots@id=ops4j@snapshots@noreleases
#
# If you want to install additional bundles from central add this entry to the list:
#    https://repo1.maven.org/maven2@id=central
